TwigBundle is a basic bundle for integrating the Twig Templating Engine into Symfony 2.×.
Installation

Download the git repository in the /src folder of your symfony root directory

cd /src
git clone git://github.com/advanderveer/TwigBundle.git

For the TwigBundle to work we will also need twig installed and the PEAR prefix loaded. You may download the Twig source in any directory you like but for this tutorial we will go by convention and place it into a twig (lowercase) folder of the /src/vendor directory of our Symfony Project.

cd /src/vendor
git clone git://github.com/fabpot/Twig.git twig

New now need to configure the autloading of our Symofony application to complete the installation. Thereopen up the applications kernel file in your application folder and add the necessary TwigBundle line to the RegisterBundles function:

  public function registerBundles()
  {
    return array(

      //Core bundles and your application bundles are lined up here

      new Bundle\TwigBundle\Bundle(),
    );
  }

The Twig “namespace” should also be registered in the autoloader. For this step open up the autoload.php in your /src folder. Because twig is a php version < 5.3 we add the Twig line to the RefisterPrefix function call like this:

$loader->registerPrefixes(array(
  //Default prefixes like zend and swift are here
  'Twig_'  => __DIR__.'/vendor/twig/lib'
));
